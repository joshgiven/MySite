- Narrative
  - A career re-routed. A Software Developer at heart whose been away from the game.
    Old skills dusted off, honed... Mental muscles exercised, strengthened...
    Programmer re-emerges, swagger comes back, not cockiness... more seasoned, wiser...

  - "programming... breaking problems down... this is the way your brain works, Josh"
  - "curiosity... not \"oh, let's just finish this task and be done...\"
     For you it's: \"let's push the boundaries, see how we can break this...\""
